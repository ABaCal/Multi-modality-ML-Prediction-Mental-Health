# Multi modality ML Prediction Mental Health

This repository contains example scripts used in the master thesis: "Multi-Modality Machine Learning Prediction of Mental Health Archetypes". The scripts demonstrate key steps in feature selection, regression modeling, and multi-modal model construction, specifically integrating polygenic scores, brain imaging, and metabolomics data to predict mental health archetypes.
